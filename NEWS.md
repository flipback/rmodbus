###2024-08-20 Release 2.1.1

1. [BREAKING] Servers now support publishing multiple slaves
2. [BREAKING] RTUViaTCPClient/RTUViaTCPSlave are gone. Please just use RTUClient directly
3. [BREAKING] Proxy collections no longer return an array when requesting a single item.
4. [BREAKING] to/from_32* use big endian order. if you want little endian order for the 
   constituent 16-bit registers, use `wordswap` before/after conversion as appropriate.
5. [BREAKING] to/from_32i works with _signed_ integers. If you want unsigned, use 32u
6. Don't time out waiting to read a response that will never come from broadcast commands
7. Don't send responses to broadcast commands as a server
8. Properly function as a server in an environment with multiple RTU slaves
9. Server now supports promiscuous mode to dump the conversation happening between a master and other slaves.
10. Add read/write multiple registers function (server and client)
11. Add mask write register function to server
12. Log to a logger object, not $stderr
13. Improve RTU read resiliency with partial reads
14. Callbacks in server to implement additional custom processing
15. Ability to use any IO (including a proxy you've set up) with RTUClient

  ```ruby
    @cl.debug = true

    @cl.with_slave(1) do |slave_1|
      slave_1.debug #=> true
    end

    @cl.with_slave(2) do |slave_2|
      slave_2.debug = false
      slave_2.debug #=> false
    end

---------------------------------------

Example:

  ```ruby
    require 'rmodbus'

    ModBus::TCPClient.new('127.0.0.1', 8502) do |cl|
      cl.with_slave(1) do |slave|
        # Read a single holding register at address 16
        slave.holding_registers[16]

        # Write a single holding register at address 16
        slave.holding_registers[16] = 123

        # Read holding registers 16 through 20
        slave.holding_registers[16..20]

        # Write holding registers 16 through 20 with some values
        slave.holding_registers[16..20] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
      end
    end
   ```

Conversion to/from 32bit registers
-----------------------------------

Some modbus devices use two registers to store 32bit values.
RModbus provides some helper functions to go back and forth between these two things when reading/writing.
The built-in examples assume registers in a particular order but it's trivial to change.

  ```ruby
    # Reading values in multiple registers (you can read more than 2 and convert them all so long as they are in multiples of 2)
    res = slave.holding_registers[0..1]
    res.inspect => [20342, 17344]
    res.to_32i => [1136676726]
    res.to_32f => [384.620788574219]

    # Writing 32b values to multiple registers
    cl.holding_registers[0..1] = [1136676726].from_32i
    cl.holding_registers[0..1] => [20342, 17344]
    cl.holding_registers[2..3] = [384.620788574219].from_32f
    cl.holding_registers[2..3] => [20342, 17344]
  ```

Support JRuby
--------------------------------------
Now you could use RModBus on JRuby without RTU implementation.

RTU classes requires gem [serialport](https://github.com/hparra/ruby-serialport) which
currently not compatible with JRuby
